Embedded Systems Journey
Welcome to my Embedded Systems repository! This is a collection of projects, experiments, and resources documenting my journey into the world of embedded systems programming and hardware development.
About My Journey
I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of hardware and software. This repository showcases my learning path, from writing low-level code to interfacing with microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators. Whether it's tinkering with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or STM32, I'm diving deep into the nuts and bolts of embedded systems.
What's Inside

Projects: Practical implementations, such as IoT devices, sensor-based systems, and real-time applications.
Code Snippets: Reusable C/C++ code for microcontrollers, including drivers and firmware.
Tutorials & Notes: My personal guides and insights on embedded concepts like interrupts, timers, and communication protocols (I2C, SPI, UART).
Resources: Links to helpful tools, datasheets, and references for embedded development.

Getting Started

Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/fatmanweb3/embedded-systems.git
Explore Projects: Check out the folders for specific microcontroller platforms or project types.
Set Up Your Environment: Install tools like Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, or STM32CubeIDE to get started.
Contribute: Feel free to share ideas, suggest improvements, or collaborate on projects!

What's Next
I'm continuously learning and adding new projects, so stay tuned for updates. My goal is to master real-time operating systems (RTOS), optimize low-power designs, and explore advanced embedded protocols.
Happy hacking, and let's build some cool embedded systems together!
